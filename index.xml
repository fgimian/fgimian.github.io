      <description>The windows-rs crate is an incredible addition to the Rust ecosystem and provides bindings for the entire Win32 SDK for Rust developers. It is also lead by some incredibly engaged and telanted developers such as Kenny Kerr and Rafael Rivera.
This post discusses the various string types which are used in the crate and how you can interact with them. These ultimately originate in the Win32 C++ SDKs and may be familiar to those who have developed Windows applications in C++ in the past; but maybe not to those approaching it with Rust for the first time.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re venturing into PowerShell cmdlet development in C# are you? Good for you! But how will you unit test those little buggers?
Some people write their unit tests in PowerShell using Pester which seems less ideal to me. At that point, you are left in an awkward position when it comes to mocking because all your mockable interfaces will be in C#, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be too late to replace them.</description>

      <description>Upon beginning my journey into C# development, I started to suspect that coverage reporting was reserved for paid products only. Only Visual Studio Enterprise (the most expensive version) and the paid JetBrains Rider IDE have coverage reporting built in. Rider users must purchase the dotCover addon to obtain this functionality.
However, upon further investigation, I was happy to find that there are several incredible open source tools which can capture code coverage for C# projects.</description>

      <description>Oh hello there, I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen you in a while! :)
So while Python is still my main language at work, I have continued to search for a new language that I would use for hobby projects. I&amp;rsquo;ve been back on Windows for several years and done a lot of PowerShell since then.
Some recent openings in our IoT department were requesting C# skills which I got really excited about for some reason, and off I went to see what all the fuss was about.</description>

      <description>With the multitude of awesome Python web frameworks out there today, I thought it would be a fun exercise to perform my own benchmarking against them and several popular WSGI servers.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m aware that this test doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer multiple real-life use-cases and may not be a great representation of real-world performance. However, I still thought it would be fun to share the results.
Test Environment Two servers were created in AWS with the following details:</description>

      <description>Hey there everyone, I thought it would be a good time to do a follow-up to my earlier post about code editors. The landscape has changed significantly since the last post, almost frighteningly so.
I&amp;rsquo;ll be evaluating the current versions of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Atom, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Visual Studio Code and JetBrains&amp;rsquo; IDEs against Sublime Text.
During this evaluation, I did focus mostly on Python development (i.e. the PyCharm IDE from JetBrains).

      <description>This post attempts to highlight my thought process in selecting a suitable stack for developing an API in Python for our current project at work.
Although I have personally benchmarked various combinations, I haven&amp;rsquo;t documented the results for this article, instead merely mentioned which frameworks and WSGI servers were found to be fast or slow.
All tests I performed (after choosing the fastest WSGI server) were done as follows:

      <description>Launchpad in macOS is definitely one of the most cumbersome apps to setup, although it can be pretty nice to have setup as it provides a little more organisation than adding your Applications folder to the Dock.
The problem up until this point was understanding how it works so that we can build automation tools around it. However, this changes today as we explore the way Launchpad works under tho hood :)</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of misinformation out there right now relating to so-called high resolution audio. Many large companies are now marketing audio products with this term, including audio systems, phones, headphones and speakers.
But what is high resolution audio exactly? Is it audio that&amp;rsquo;s provided at a higher sample rate or bit depth than audio CDs? Is it a particular frequency balance on headphones? Is it to do with how the audio was recorded and mastered?</description>

      <description>With the various pre-processed languages used for web (e.g. Coffeescript, LESS .etc), we often reach for tools like Gulp, Grunt and Brunch. However, what if we could just strip it back to basics and use a shell script? This could potentially save you the entire Node.js stack if you only plan to use SCSS (via LibSass).
Firstly, we&amp;rsquo;re going to need to run both our development server (for the respective framework) and one or more other commands to watch and pre-process files.</description>

      <description>Installing Windows on a Mac should be a piece of cake with Bootcamp, but that rarely is the case. In fact, I would personally say that Boot Camp Assistant is one of the worst apps that comes with OS X and unlike the rest, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work seamlessly.
A few of its drawbacks:
It only supports a drive with a single partition. It often throws very obscure error messages with limited detail.</description>

      <description>Good ol&amp;rsquo; plist files. They are at the core of OS X for storing application settings and they work really well.
If you have ever automated part of your OS X build or changed some cool hidden feature, you have probably used the defaults command to do so. The defaults command is great and is still recommended for simple things, but if you want to edit complex plist structures like arrays, dicts and nested structures, you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably come across PlistBuddy.</description>

      <description>Hello guys, hope everyone is doing well. I&amp;rsquo;ll start this post by admitting that I absolutely love Sublime Text and already own a license for it. But, I&amp;rsquo;m a curious lad who likes to try new things and therefore I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help being interested in trying out the slew of new open source and also payware editors which are popping up.
As you also can tell, I primarily develop in Python but do a lot of frontend work too, so CSS and Javascript are of interest.</description>

      <description>The nose Python test framework is a really good choice for writing and running your tests. However, it seems that the author is deprecating the use of nose.collector which was used when running the test setuptools command:
1 python setup.py test Furthermore, even in its current form, the nose collector doesn&amp;rsquo;t correctly work with plugins such as coverage.py.
The recommended way is to use the nosetests setuptools command instead. Though, this presents several problems:</description>

      <description>In the Setting up Virtual Development Environments for Python post, we discussed the use of pythonbrew for managing Python versions and their related virtualenvs. If you do enjoy pythonbrew, then be sure to check out pythonz which is now the active fork of the original project and has resolved almost all issues that I had originally reported.
However, there is another alternative called pyenv which has several significant advantages. Probably one of the biggest is the fact that pyenv doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on Python 2.</description>

      <description>While writing unit tests in Python, there will often be times where you&amp;rsquo;ll need to fake the result of a function as testing against the actual function may be impossible. A simple example is a random function since one can&amp;rsquo;t predict what it will return. Another could be a database call for a database that&amp;rsquo;s only available in certain environments.
Python&amp;rsquo;s mock library is the de facto standard when mocking functions in Python, yet I have always struggled to understand it from the official documentation.</description>

I have nothing but good things to say about PhantomJS and have used it successfully for testing in the past. However, while working on some pull requests for splinter recently, I discovered that Chrome and Firefox can also be configured to do the same thing.</description>

As such, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d put together an article of the many amazing libraries that I think every Python programmer needs to know about. Now there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that there are heaps that I&amp;rsquo;ve missed, but we have to start somewhere.</description>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be guiding you through setting up Hostmonster (or similar shared hosting providers) to serve a Python Flask web application. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using my new Flaskage template project as the application, but naturally you can adapt this solution to work with any Flask application.
We&amp;rsquo;ll create a temporary build directory to put things in:

The following procedure depends on the Transmission API, so be sure turn on the web admin interface under Remote in the Transmission preferences, listening on (default) port 9091.</description>

As you could tell from my earlier posts, I am a Windows user and have always used Microsoft products since DOS 5. Though, I have always had a keen eye on Apple products, OSX and the lovely world of Macs. Unlike most out there, I don&amp;rsquo;t think that Mac vs PC is an argument worth getting into.</description>

      <description>So you want to start developing a Python application do ya? Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we are planning to use a smaller framework like Flask which is a framework I&amp;rsquo;m really loving at the moment.
Update (6th of April 2014): In the past, I had found Flask&amp;rsquo;s in-built development server to be a bit unstable which is why I put together this entry but this is no longer the case. As such, I now recommend using the dev server that comes with Flask for development purposes.</description>

      <description>Setting up virtual environments for Python is always a great way to keep your projects and their related Python packages independent.
Virtualenv Virtualenv is the de-facto standard choice for Python environments. It&amp;rsquo;s capable of creating independent Python module groupings which you can switch to and from using commands. Unfortunately, virtualenv does not install and manage multiple versions of Python, but we&amp;rsquo;ll get to a solution for that with pythonbrew later.</description>

      <description>In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll be going through the creation of virtual Ruby development environments. Using this sort of approach when developing applications allows you to start from a clean state at any time and also have vastly different environments setup for various projects on the same server.
I must say that the brilliant RVM is about as good as it gets when it comes to virtual development environments. RVM can install Ruby for you and contains a very complete virtual environment experience with bash completion and even automatic switching of environments based on the project directory you are in.</description>

      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s almost here folks! Windows 8 arrives this Friday and many people are nervous. I was too the first time I used it; in fact, I hated it! But things have changed significantly for me now. I&amp;rsquo;m currently running Windows 8 Pro RTM (via MSDN) as my main OS and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier. I&amp;rsquo;d go as far as to say that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see myself going back to or missing Windows 7 in the future at all.</description>

      <description>Hello there, my name is Fotis but most my friends call me Fots or something more insulting &amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;ll usually respond to just about anything :)
I like computers &amp;hellip; oh who am I kidding, I freaking love them! I think they are probably the meaning of life or something of that magnitude. I mean really, how cool are these things!?!?
Welcome to my blog which is dedicated to technology with a focus on coding, desktop computers and servers with a little tablet thrown in on the odd day.</description>
